# GPU-Based Computation of Transcendental Functions

This repository will contain the implementation of transcendental function computations on GPUs using Tensor Cores.

## Project Overview

Modern GPUs are widely used for computationally intensive applications such as deep learning, scientific modeling, and image recognition. However, underutilization of certain on-chip resources leads to performance inefficiencies. In this project, we utilize **Tensor Cores** to accelerate transcendental function computations, achieving significant improvements in execution speed and energy efficiency compared to SFU and SP units.

## Current Status

ðŸš§ **Code is currently being compiled and will be uploaded soon!** ðŸš§

## Performance Improvements

Initial results show:
- Up to **4.1Ã— speedup** over SP units.
- Up to **3.4Ã— speedup** over SFU units.
- Up to **18% reduction in energy consumption** compared to SP.
- Up to **23% reduction in energy consumption** compared to SFU.
- **100% accuracy** compared to CPU results (up to five decimal places).

## Future Updates

- [ ] Upload complete implementation.
- [ ] Provide benchmarking scripts.
- [ ] Add installation and usage instructions.

Stay tuned for updates! ðŸ˜Š
